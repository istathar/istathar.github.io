<p>
Andrew Cowie is a long time Linux engineer, but—somewhat unusually—started his
career as an <b>infantry officer</b> in the Canadian army, having graduated
from <a href="https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en">Royal Military College, Kingston</a>
with a degree in <b>engineering physics</b>. He saw service across North America and a
tour in the former Yugoslavia. He later ran operations for a mobile internet
company in Manhattan and was a part of recovering the firm after the Sept 11
attacks.
</p>

<p>
Moving to Australia he <b>founded</b> a consulting form helping a worldwide
clientèle on their operations management, specializing in planning and
executing major upgrades to critical infrastructure. He also has significant
experience helping startups solve difficult problems in uncertain and complex
environments.
</p>

<p>
He later worked as head of engineering at a hosting company where designed and
deployed a scalable infrastructure and established Haskell as the working
language for all internal systems with a view to improving the calibre of
software being developed. Moving into financial services, he was an
engineering manager in the Systems Engineering group at Commonwealth Bank with
accountability for operations and engineering on their Big Data™ analytics
platform and later led the integration between containerized infrastructure
and cyber security.
</p>

<p>
Andrew has recently joined innovative AI startup <a
href="https://www.daisee.com/">daisee</a> as <b>VP Engineering</b>. Already
successfully using Haskell to power their speech analysis system, Andrew is
thrilled to be working with a talented team of engineers and data scientists
on the challenge of scaling up as the company continues to grow.
</p>

<p>
On the technical side, Andrew is a strong <b>open source</b> advocate and
contributed to the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Desktop for many
years. Past experience includes coding in C, Perl, and Java but for almost ten
years now he has concentrated exclusively in Haskell and has experience both
as a developer himself and in growing people to be able to use <a
href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> in team settings. Previous work
emphasized reliable distributed systems; lately he has been focused on tools
for engineers, developing publishing toolchains for building better technical
documentation and is now doing some original work on a new domain specific
language for procedures.
</p>

<p>
Andrew has experience as a <b>corporate director</b>, having served on the
boards of international organizations promoting excellence, leadership, and
innovation amongst youth; advocating Linux; and promoting Open Source
professionals’ interests. Andrew has also been a frequent <b>conference
speaker</b>, presenting about increasing the level of professionalism in the
operations world and encouraging people to pursue the cause of freedom—in
software and in the world beyond.
