    <h1 style="line-height: 1; font-weight: 400; color: #333366;">Andrew Frederick Cowie</h1>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; color: #c1ba99;">rmc, BEng</h3>
    
    <p>
    Andrew Cowie is a long time Linux engineer, but—somewhat unusually—started his
    career as an <b>infantry officer</b> in the Canadian army, having graduated
    from <a href="https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en">Royal Military College, Kingston</a>
    with a degree in <b>engineering physics</b>. He saw service across North America and a
    tour in the former Yugoslavia. He later ran operations for a mobile internet
    company in Manhattan and was a part of recovering the firm after the Sept 11
    attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moving to Australia he <b>founded</b> a consulting firm helping a worldwide
    clientèle on their operations management, specializing in planning and
    executing major upgrades to critical infrastructure. He also had significant
    experience helping startups solve difficult problems in uncertain and complex
    environments.

    <p>
    He later worked as head of engineering at a hosting company where designed
    and deployed a scalable infrastructure and established Haskell as the
    working language for all internal systems. Moving into financial services,
    he was an engineering manager in the Systems Engineering group at <a
    href="https://www.commbank.com.au/">Commonwealth Bank</a> with
    accountability for operations and engineering on their Big Data™ analytics
    platform and later led the integration between containerized
    infrastructure and cyber security. Most recently he was <b>VP
    Engineering</b> at an innovative AI startup where he successfully
    re-architected their entire production system, grew a talented team of
    Haskell developers and systems engineers, and dramatically improved
    development velocity, increased platform availability, and reduced
    infrastructure cost.

    <p>
    On the technical side, Andrew is a strong <b>open source</b> advocate and
    contributed to the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Desktop for many
    years. Past experience includes coding in C, Perl, and Java but for almost ten
    years now he has concentrated exclusively in Haskell and has experience both
    as a developer himself and in growing people to be able to use <a
    href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> in team settings. Previous work
    emphasized reliable distributed systems; lately he has been focused on tools
    for engineers, developing publishing toolchains for building better technical
    documentation and is now doing some original work on a new domain specific
    language for procedures.
