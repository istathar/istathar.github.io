<p>
Andrew Cowie is a long time Linux engineer, but—somewhat unusually—started his
career as an infantry officer in the Canadian army, having graduated from <a
href="https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en">Royal Military College, Kingston</a>
with a degree in engineering physics. He saw service across North America and a
tour in the former Yugoslavia. He later ran operations for a mobile internet
company in Manhattan and was a part of recovering the firm after the Sept 11
attacks.
</p>

<p>
Moving to Australia he founded <a
href="https://www.operationaldynamics.com/">Operational Dynamics</a> and for
many years worked with a worldwide clientèle on their operations management,
specializing in planning and executing major upgrades to critical
infrastructure. He also has significant experience solving difficult problems
in uncertain and complex environments.
</p>

<p>
More recently, Andrew was Head of Engineering at <a
href="https://www.anchor.com.au/">Anchor Systems</a>, where he designed and
deployed a scalable hosting infrastructure on OpenStack. He established Haskell
as the working language for all internal systems with a view to improving the
calibre of software being developed. Focus was on aggressively gathering
metrics and building statistical model based decision capabilities to augment
monitoring, troubleshooting, and capacity planning.
</p>

<p>
Andrew is presently working as a Systems Engineer in the Application
Infrastructure group at <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/">Commonwealth
Bank</a>. He had accoutability for engineering practice on the analytics
platform and is now leading the integration between containerized
infrastructure and cyber security.
</p>

<p>
On the technical side, Andrew is a strong Open Source advocate and contributed
to the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Desktop for many years. Past
experience includes coding in C, Perl, and Java. Recent work has emphasised
reliable distriuted systems and has concentrated heavily on the <a
href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> functional programming
language to that end.
</p>

<p>
Andrew has wide experience as a corporate director, having served on the boards
of international organizations promoting excellence, leadership, and innovation
amongst youth; advocating Linux; and promoting Open Source professionals’
interests.
</p>

<p>
Andrew is a frequent conference speaker, presenting about increasing the
level of professionalism in the operations world, and encouraging
people to pursue the cause of freedom—in software and in the
world beyond.
